# Ferro

A ferrofluids animation project

## Introduction

This is a graphics final project done in SUTD.
In this project, we aim to animate ferrofluids using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.

## How to

Build the project with Visual Studio 2010 and run ferro.exe.

The system is paused by default. This is to cater to systems that cannot run 2000 particles (which is the initial amount).

Adjust the number of particles with keys 'a' and 'c'. Start the system with 'p'. 

You may step through the system while paused using the 's' key.

## Interactions

Mouse - Move the camera

Key ' ' - Resets camera

Key 'p' - Pause/ unpause the system

Key 's' - Step system forward by one time step. Only works when paused.


Key 'a' - Add 125 particles into the system

Key 'c' - Clear all particles in the system


Key 'b' - Draw boundary box

Key 'f' - Draw Forcesphere


Key 'h' - Move Forcesphere in - y axis

Key 'y' - Move Forcesphere in + y axis

Key 'u' - Move Forcesphere in - x axis

Key 'j' - Move Forcesphere in + x axis

Key 'i' - Move Forcesphere in - z axis

Key 'k' - Move Forcesphere in + z axis
